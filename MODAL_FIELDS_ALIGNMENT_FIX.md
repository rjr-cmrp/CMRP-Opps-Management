# Modal Fields Alignment Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The Edit Modal and Create Modal had different fields being displayed:
- The Create Modal was correctly showing all fields defined in the `editableFields` array
- The Edit Modal was only showing fields that existed in the current row data, causing some fields to be missing

## Root Cause
In the `showEditRowModal` function, the form fields were created with a conditional check:
```javascript
if (headerExists || normalizedHeaderExists) {
    // Create form field only if the field exists in headers or has a normalized equivalent
    // This caused some fields to be missing when they weren't in the current row data
}
```

## Fix Applied
Modified the `showEditRowModal` function to always create form fields for all items in the `editableFields` array, matching the behavior of the Create Modal:

1. Removed the conditional check that was filtering out fields
2. Fixed indentation issues that were causing syntax errors
3. Enhanced dropdown selection to properly select the current value
4. Improved date field handling to properly format dates

## Testing
To verify the fix works correctly, a test HTML file has been created (`test_modal_fix.html`) that:
1. Opens the main app
2. Provides instructions to check both Edit and Create modals
3. Includes a comparison script to run in the browser console to verify that both modals have the same fields

## Conclusion
Both the Edit Modal and Create Modal now display the same set of fields, including all dropdown fields (A, C, R, U, D, solutions, etc.), regardless of whether the fields exist in the current row data.
